Bug fixed:
-When searching in FAQ page a word that is contained into a <a> tag, the yellow highlight HTML code was inserted into the href attribute. This caused a distorted output. Now nothing is allowed to be inserted between HTML tags.

Other:
-Correction in subject of suggestion's mail when no member connected.
